  ### Configure Cache ###

  # If you don't want to use Rails.cache (Rack::Attack's default), then
  # configure it here.
  #
  # Note: The store is only used for throttling (not blocklisting and
  # safelisting). It must implement .increment and .write like
  # ActiveSupport::Cache::Store

  # Rack::Attack.cache.store = ActiveSupport::Cache::MemoryStore.new

  ### Throttle Spammy Clients ###

  # If any single client IP is making tons of requests, then they're
  # probably malicious or a poorly-configured scraper. Either way, they
  # don't deserve to hog all of the app server's CPU. Cut them off!
  #
  # Note: If you're serving assets through rack, those requests may be
  # counted by rack-attack and this throttle may be activated too
  # quickly. If so, enable the condition to exclude them from tracking.

  # Throttle all requests by IP (60rpm)
  #
  # Key: "rack::attack:#{Time.now.to_i/:period}:req/ip:#{req.ip}"
  throttle('req/ip', limit: 300, period: 5.minutes, &:ip) # unless req.path.start_with?('/assets')

  ### Prevent Brute-Force Login Attacks ###

  # The most common brute-force login attack is a brute-force password
  # attack where an attacker simply tries a large number of emails and
  # passwords to see if any credentials match.
  #
  # Another common method of attack is to use a swarm of computers with
  # different IPs to try brute-forcing a password for a specific account.

  # Throttle POST requests to /login by IP address
  #
  # Key: "rack::attack:#{Time.now.to_i/:period}:logins/ip:#{req.ip}"
  #
  # Allows 20 requests in 8  seconds
  #        40 requests in 64 seconds
  #        ...
  #        100 requests in 0.38 days (~250 requests/day)

  (1..5).each do |level|
    throttle("logins/ip/#{level}", limit: (level * 20), period: (8**level).seconds) do |req|
      req.ip if req.path == '/login' && req.post?
    end
  end

  # Throttle POST requests to /login by email param
  #
  # Key: "rack::attack:#{Time.now.to_i/:period}:logins/email:#{req.email}"
  #
  # Note: This creates a problem where a malicious user could intentionally
  # throttle logins for another user and force their login requests to be
  # denied, but that's not very common and shouldn't happen to you. (Knock
  # on wood!)
  throttle('logins/email', limit: 5, period: 20.seconds) do |req|
    if req.path == '/login' && req.post?
      # return the email if present, nil otherwise
      req.params['email'].presence
    end
  end

  ### Custom Throttle Response ###

  # By default, Rack::Attack returns an HTTP 429 for throttled responses,
  # which is just fine.
  #
  # If you want to return 503 so that the attacker might be fooled into
  # believing that they've successfully broken your app (or you just want to
  # customize the response), then uncomment these lines.
  # self.throttled_response = lambda do |env|
  #  [ 503,  # status
  #    {},   # headers
  #    ['']] # body
  # end

  self.throttled_responder = lambda do |request|
    retry_after = (request.env['rack.attack.match_data'] || {})[:period]
    [
      429,
      { 'Content-Type' => 'application/json', 'Retry-After' => retry_after.to_s },
      [{ error: 'Throttle limit reached. Retry later.' }.to_json]
    ]
  end

  # Allow all local traffic
  safelist('allow-localhost') do |req|
    req.ip == '127.0.0.1' || req.ip == '::1'
  end
end

class Rack::Attack::Request < Rack::Request
  def localhost?
    ip == '127.0.0.1'
  end
end

Rack::Attack.safelist('localhost', &:localhost?)
